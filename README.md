# personal-dev-crew

A global Claude Code skill set for building personal apps — from idea to shipped product.

Orchestrates a full product team: PM → UX → Tech Lead → Backend → Frontend → QA → DevOps, all running as Claude Code skills.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install globally
git clone https://github.com/kevbu/personal-dev-crew
cd personal-dev-crew
./install.sh
```

Then in any project:

```
/build-app a personal news app that shows me tech and AI news
```

## PM Skills (via plugin marketplace)

Install separately — these power the early discovery phases:

```
/plugin marketplace add deanpeters/Product-Manager-Skills
/plugin install prd-development@pm-skills
/plugin install user-story@pm-skills
/plugin install problem-statement@pm-skills
/plugin install prioritization-advisor@pm-skills
/plugin install epic-breakdown-advisor@pm-skills
/plugin install jobs-to-be-done@pm-skills
```

## GitHub Backlog Workflow

File GitHub Issues for bugs, features, and improvements — then let the crew implement them:

```
/work-backlog --limit 3
```

What happens:
1. `/product-manager` reads open issues and ranks them (security → bugs → features) using PM frameworks from [RefoundAI/lenny-skills](https://github.com/RefoundAI/lenny-skills)
2. For each prioritized issue (up to `--limit`): creates a worktree + branch `issue/<N>-<slug>`, dispatches `/indie-agent` (spec → implement → QA → review → ship), and posts the PR link as a comment on the issue
3. Issues auto-close on PR merge via `Closes #<N>` in the PR body

```
/product-manager              # only prioritize, don't implement yet
/work-backlog --dry-run       # preview which tickets would run
/work-backlog --issue 42      # implement a single specific issue
/work-backlog --limit 1       # implement only the top-ranked ticket
```

Requires: `gh auth login` and `/adjust` already run for the project.

---

## The Full Workflow

```
/build-app <your app idea>
```

Runs this pipeline automatically, pausing at 3 approval gates:

```
Problem Statement → PRD
        ↓
    GATE 1: approve what gets built
        ↓
Tech Lead → UX Design
        ↓
    GATE 2: approve stack + design
        ↓
Spec → Implementation → QA → Review
        ↓
    GATE 3: approve before shipping
        ↓
      Ship → PR + deployed app
        ↓
   File Findings → leftover QA/review findings opened as GitHub Issues
```

Or run individual agents manually:

```
/techlead       # architecture decisions
/backend        # build API + data model
/frontend-design # build UI components
/qa             # write + run tests
/devops         # CI/CD + deployment setup
```

## Install

### Global install (recommended)

```bash
./install.sh
```

This copies all skills to `~/.claude/skills/`.

### Manual

```bash
cp -r skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

## Stack Defaults

The `tech-lead` skill defaults to:

| Layer | Default |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React + Vite + Tailwind |
| Backend | Python + FastAPI |
| Database | SQLite (local) / PostgreSQL (cloud) |
| Testing | pytest + Vitest + Playwright |
| Deploy | Docker Compose (local) / Fly.io (cloud) |
